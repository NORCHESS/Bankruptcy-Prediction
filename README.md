# Bankruptcy-Prediction
The economic consequences of a firmâ€™s bankruptcy can be devastating for the society. Layoffs, worsened standard of living, loss of confidence and trust in public institutions, contagious negative effects on other firms, economic stagnation can be some of the outcomes. This makes bankruptcy prediction an essential and critical task for variety of interest groups. While many authors have built both statistical and Machine Learning models for effective bankruptcy prediction, very few have analyzed the power of a number of common Machine Learning models combined with several Feature Selection and Resampling Techniques at the same time on the same set of data samples. Hence, the purpose of this study is to execute a comprehensive analysis using twelve most common machine learning algorithms including Multi-Layer Perceptron combined with four Feature Selection and two Resampling Techniques. The experiments demonstrate that the models with Gradient Boosting framework have superior performance in terms of the prediction accuracy, recall and AUC scores. Moreover, Univariate Feature Selection outperforms the rest of the dataset Dimensionality Reduction techniques applied in this study. It has also been found out that Adaptive Synthetic Sampling beats Synthetic Minority Oversampling technique which has been used to deal with the class imbalance issue.
